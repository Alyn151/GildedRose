# Getting Started

I started with the visual studio spa template for angular. I already had this dev env setup so I am not 100% sure what you need installed before you can run it.
- Visual Studio 2022
- .NET 7
- Node and NPM
- Angular CLI

I used an in memory DB to make it easier to get setup and running so you wouldn't have to deal with db creation or connection strings

Once you have the dev env setup and project opened in visual studio, you should be able to just hit F5 to run the app, front end and backend.

http://localhost:<port>/swagger will give you the swagger doc with the requested endpoints.
